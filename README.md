[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/mateuscv/shingeki-outro-lado)](https://github.com/mateuscv/shingeki-outro-lado/releases/latest)

Website created in collab with @MateusAlvesP for the 'Internet Systems II' intro project (7th semester - Computer Engineering @ FURG). Pure HTML/CSS/JS coding only (bar resources).

Note: We aren't actually handling any form inputs, be it polls or contact forms. This assignment consisted just of making a css/html/js showcase website.
